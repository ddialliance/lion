Lion -Capturing platform for the DDI4 model
===========================================

Drupal 7 site and custom modules for modeling DDI4 in the project [DDI Moving Forward](https://ddi-alliance.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=491703)

# Setup

1. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com)

2. Clone this repository

3. Get SQL-dump from a friendly developer and place it in `sql-dump`

5. Copy `settings.example.php` to a file named `settings.php`.
   default username password can be used during local development (no changes needed), change it if you want to use this setup for a public server.

5. Run `docker-compose up` this will import the sql-dump and set up the system

6. Your local development instance should now run on http://localhost:8080

# Development terminal

To get an interactive shell for the container run: `docker exec -it lion_web_1 /bin/bash` (if your continer is named `lion_web_1`)

In the terminal you can use [drush](https://drushcommands.com) to do various tasks.

Some examples:

* `drush cc all` clear all cache
* `drush sql-query 'DELETE FROM cache;'` force clear all cache by deleting everything in the cache table
* `drush ws` show latest log entries
